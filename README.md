# DPhil Chapter 6 Code and Diagrams

This repository contains Python code and system dynamics diagrams used in Chapter 6 of my DPhil thesis. It includes simulations of microbial dynamics and reinforcement learning algorithms for analyzing system behavior.

## How to Use

The code requires Python 3 and several additional packages such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, and `odeint`.

### Key Components
- **Microbial System Simulation**: Models the dynamics of a 3-species microbial system using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- **SARSA Reinforcement Learning**: Implements the SARSA algorithm for decision-making and optimization in microbial system control.
- **Tile Coding**: Encodes continuous state-action spaces for reinforcement learning.

### Example Scripts
Example scripts can be found in the code base to demonstrate the usage of SARSA and the microbial system simulator. You can visualize the microbial species' behavior over time using the plotting functionality provided.
